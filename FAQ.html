<p id="hiddenParagraph" class="hidden">
  <b>Polish Up Online</b> is more than just a language course — it’s a personalized journey into the heart of the Polish language, <b>designed to empower</b> you to speak with clarity and confidence.
<br><br>Language learning shouldn’t be one-size-fits-all. 
<br>That’s why I offer a fully <b>tailored experience built around <i>you</i></b> — your pace, your interests, and your goals.

<br><br>You can choose between two formats, depending on how deep you want to dive:  
  <br>
  <a href="./courses.html#bas" id="more3"> steady-flow </a>   and   
  <a href="./courses.html#int" id="more3"> rapid-fire </a>.<br><br>
Both paths lead to the same <b>destination: real progress</b>, made on your terms, with methods that truly resonate with the way <i>you</i> learn best.</p>


<button id="showMoreTrigger2" class="clickable">HOW WE DO IT?</button>
<p id="hiddenParagraph2" class="hidden">

First, let’s get to know each other.<br>

<b>☞ Start by booking a </b><a href="./free.html" id="more3"><b>free demo call</b></a>, where I’ll walk you through your online Classroom. 

<br><br>During our first meet-up, we’ll:<br>

a) Explore how the platform works,<br>

b) Fill out two short questionnaires: one about your learning goals, and another about your learning style (how you learn best),<br>

c) Discuss your schedule, motivation, and any previous experience you bring.<br><br>

Based on all of this, I’ll create <b>a custom learning roadmap</b> designed specifically for you — so from the very beginning, everything we do is clear, purposeful, and aligned with your unique learning profile.

<br><br><b>☞ Be sure to review the <a href="./resources/PolishUp_syllabus.pdf" target="_blank" id="more3"><b>course curriculum</b></a></b>,
<br>
where I outline the foundation of my teaching aproach,
as well as <a href="./courses.html#cardWrapper" target="" id="more3">the pricing section</a> to choose the plan that best fits your needs.</p>

<button id="showMoreTrigger3" class="clickable">WHAT'S THE OUTCOME? / WHY DO THIS?</button>
<p id="hiddenParagraph3" class="hidden">The outcome is up to <i>you</i> — and that’s the best part.<br>

From day one, you’re not just a student — you’re a co-creator of your own learning experience, with a <b>key role in shaping every step of the course</b>. <i>Together</i>, we’ll explore your story, goals, motivations, and any challenges you face — all of which form the foundation for a personalized course plan tailored to your unique learning style and needs.

<br><br>We’ll break down your long-term ambitions into bite-sized, motivating milestones at every stage, making sure they align perfectly with your personal learning journey. Whether you want to survive your first visit to Poland, chat confidently with your in-laws, or pass a language exam — we’ll set clear, realistic goals and work step by step to get you there.

This approach means your progress isn’t just measurable — it's truly centered on what matters most to you. It’s <b>meaningful</b>, <b>personal</b>, and <b>empowering</b>.

<button id="showMoreTrigger4" class="clickable">WHO AM I?</button>
<div id="hiddenParagraph4" class="hidden">
  

I’m a 30-year-old language nerd, digital nomad in the making, and your future Polish language mentor.

Currently, I'm studying English Philology and building my career as a teacher of Polish as a foreign language —
supporting learners like you in expressing themselves freely. 
<br>
<br>Recently, I've also gotten into web development — diving into coding languages — and this site, as well as <a href="https://dawaj.online" target="_blank" id="more3">dawaj.online</a>  mark the beginning of my coding path, yaay!<br><br>

  <b>📚 My Language Learning Journey</b><br><br>
My latest focus is German and Turkish, but my curiosity for languages doesn’t stop there.
Languages I speak and study:<br><br>
    • Polish — native,<br>
    • English — C1,<br>
    • Czech & German — B1,<br>
    • Ukrainian — A2,<br>
    • Spanish — A1,<br>
    • Plus bits and pieces of Hindi, Slovak, Italian, Turkish, Dutch, Arabic, Icelandic and Polish Sign Language.<br><br>
      It’s not about being perfect. <br>It’s about the joy of being brave!<br><br>


  <br><b>👩‍🏫 My Language Teaching Journey</b><br>
  <br>I’ve taught English for years, and now I’m giving birth to Polish courses for online learners. 
  My idea is to make your language learning fun, flexible, and truly personal — while building a location-independent life doing what I love the most: <i>connecting through language.</i>
<br><br>  

Deep down, I know this is more than learning. <br>It’s becoming.<br><br>
